## Inventory Management Simulation

Let's simulate the apple inventory management over a span of 52 weeks for FreshMart. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
```

We will start by initializing our variables:

```{r initialization}
# Initial values
inventory <- 500
weeks <- 52
total_sales <- 0
total_orders <- 0
order_status <- FALSE
weeks_until_delivery <- 0

# Vectors to store weekly data
weekly_sales_vector <- numeric(weeks)
deliveries_received_vector <- numeric(weeks)
remaining_inventory_vector <- numeric(weeks)
```

Now, let's run our simulation:

```{r simulation}
# Fix the seed
set.seed(123)

# Run the simulation
for (week in 1:weeks) {
  # Generate non-negative sales following a normal distribution
  weekly_sales <- max(0, round(rnorm(1, mean=100, sd=15)))
  
  # Check if demand exceeds available inventory
  weekly_sales <- min(weekly_sales, inventory)
  
  # Reduce inventory by weekly sales
  inventory <- inventory - weekly_sales
  total_sales <- total_sales + weekly_sales
  
  # Store weekly sales data
  weekly_sales_vector[week] <- weekly_sales
  
  # Check if order arrives
  if (order_status && weeks_until_delivery == 0) {
    inventory <- inventory + 300
    order_status <- FALSE
    deliveries_received_vector[week] <- 300
  } else if (order_status) {
    weeks_until_delivery <- weeks_until_delivery - 1
    deliveries_received_vector[week] <- 0
  } else {
    deliveries_received_vector[week] <- 0
  }
  
  # Check if new order should be placed
  if (inventory < 400 && !order_status) {
    order_status <- TRUE
    weeks_until_delivery <- 2
    total_orders <- total_orders + 1
  }
  
  # Store remaining inventory data
  remaining_inventory_vector[week] <- inventory
}
```

Finally, let's present our annual report using the `kable` package:

```{r report}
annual_report <- tibble(
  Week = 1:weeks,
  `Apples Sold` = weekly_sales_vector,
  `Deliveries Received` = deliveries_received_vector,
  `Remaining Inventory` = remaining_inventory_vector
)

kable(annual_report, caption = "Annual Report for FreshMart's Apple Inventory", align = 'c')
```
